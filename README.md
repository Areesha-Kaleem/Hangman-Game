# Hangman-Game
 This code is a basic hangman game with multiple levels. It uses the random module and the art module to display fancy text. The player is welcomed, prompted to guess letters, and their progress is displayed. The score is adjusted based on correct or incorrect guesses, and the game ends with a win message and total score.
